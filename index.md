## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student (2023-) in Machine Learning and Public Policy at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu). Previously, I received my B.S. in Statistics at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My research field lies in the intersection of **machine learning, statistics, and operations research**. 
I am interested in probabilistic modeling of sequential processes and uncertainty quantification, with a focus on their role in robust decision-making in practice.
