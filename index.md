## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. student (2023-) in Machine Learning and Public Policy at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu). Previously, I received my B.S. in Statistics at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest lies in the intersection of **machine learning, statistics, and operations research**. 
I work on probabilistic machine learning, uncertainty quantification, sequential modeling, and causal inference, with a focus on their applications in the operations and management of power systems, disaster response, and other high-risk societal challenges.
