## Welcome!

I am a second-year Ph.D. student with [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/) and [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/),
advised by [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu).
Previously, I received my B.S. in Statistics at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). 

My research interests lie in developing data-driven and computational methods for social good,
blending **machine learning, statistics, and operations research**.
My works span areas such as generative modeling, uncertainty quantification, sequential analysis, and causal inference.
Some of my application fields include sustainability, public health, and seismology.
